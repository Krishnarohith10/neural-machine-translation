# neural-machine-translation

This notebook trains a sequence to sequence (seq2seq) model for Spanish to English translation. This is an advanced example that assumes some knowledge of sequence to sequence models.

After training the model in this notebook, you will be able to input a Spanish sentence, such as "Â¿todavia estan en casa?", and return the English translation: "are you still at home?"
